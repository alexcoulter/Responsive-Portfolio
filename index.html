      <p>My name is James Alexander Coulter but I go by Alex. I was born and raised in Durham, North Carolina
        and went
        to school down the road at UNC Chapel Hill. I've been interested in coding since I was in 9th grade
        and got my first graphing calculator for Geometry class. I found myself making simple programs with
        loops and user commands.
        Since then, I've taken a few formal courses on HTML and Javascript, but I've mostly found free
        resources online to
        learn from. That is until now. I am currently enrolled in a 6 month coding bootcamp through UNC
        Chapel Hill and am excited to further my education and hone my skillset.</p>
        <br>
    
    <p>I've been playin soccer since I was four years old and presenty play in an over 30 soccer league
        in Chapel Hill. I also enjoy playing disc golf with friends, going to the gym, and playing the
        guitar. I am
        currently bartending in downtown Durham but am hoping to transition soon into a career involving
        application and web development. I think that my hard-working nature and analytical skills will lead
        me to become a very competitive job candidate once I have expanded on my portfolio.
