# Responsive-Portfolio

### Description
* I created this online portfolio to show prospective employers who I am and what I have to offer
* This project involved me taking my original portpholio and updating it using Bootstrap and media queries to make it responsive
* With these improvements, my portfolio's content scales up and down on different sized screens so it looks as good on a cell phone as it does on a desktop computer.

## Screen sizes supported
* large - `> 980px wide`
* medium - `769px - 980px wide`
* small - `641px - 768px wide`
* x-small - `<= 640px wide`
